                    <h2>Places</h2>
                    <p>Travelling exposes you to new cultural settings, religious practices and traditions, art, and much more. It could be an exceptionally difficult task because there are so many places that are multicultural such as India. There is nothing more joyous than experiencing the cultures and heritage of the world you live in. India is one of the most diverse nations of the world and planning a trip to even one of its states is a challenge. CULT-kri is here to help you choose from all that India has to give. We have given hours to research and assembled the complete data of places that are filled with century-long practices of art and food, buildings, streets, etc. These are worth a visit. In a time when ancestral traditions are dying, we work to preserve and expose these beautiful customs of our country to a worldwide audience.</p>

                    <h2>Food</h2>
                    <p>Since the dawn of time, food has been a crucial part of our lives. Whether it is a community or neighborhood, food has always kept us connected with each other's traditions and cultures. It doesn't matter if one is foody or not, delicious meals are always an attraction. Trying new dishes exposes you to new flavors and combinations but also to new traditions of the places you are visiting. Food represents the historical heritage and for a country as culturally diverse as India, food is one source of experiencing different methods of celebration and cooking. CULT-kri presents you with some food combinations and meals famous in the streets of Indian states</p>

                    <h2>Art Work</h2>
                    <p>Art is the best way to preserve time. The cavemen drew on the walls which is the reason why we know about their existence. Art keeps traditions alive even after the people who invented them are gone. The Hunters in ancient times, the monarchs in medieval times, and us in modern times, we all conserve beautiful things. India is home to one of the oldest and best artworks and artforms. Whether it is the leatherwork of Jajmau(Kanpur) or the embroidery of Lucknow, all of these fields of art reflect on our century-long traditions and cultures. Our team at CULT-kri is on a mission to connect the world with these Arts. We connect you to the original famous shops/places for these dying art forms. These forms of art are a reminder of our past and all the beautiful customs followed back then.</p>
